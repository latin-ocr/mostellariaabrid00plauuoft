16 MOSTELLARIA

Past all repair, ay, tumble from the height
To its foundation: none can help my plight.
My beart. aches, when I think what now
I am, what was iu days gone by!
No Iustior lad was then, I vow,
The quoit, the spear, t-he ball to ply,
ΤΟ ride or run, in every feat.
Ah me! Then life was passing· sweet!
Then thrift and hardihood to all I taught;
Then all the best from me their model sought;
Now, t-hanks to my own wicked ways, a thing of
nought. W. J. G.

PHILE. Oh, what. a lovely bath, Scapha! It’s never
been so nice
For age-s, and I feel so fresh !
SC. And hay's gone down in price.

How things do happen!
PHILE. What have hay and prices got to do
With soap and water?
SC. Well, I think, about as much as you
Cone-ern y-ourself with muthius] hay in sunshine,
silly girl!

PHILO. Ο Queen of love! This is the storin that's
put me in a whirl!
My lliodesty, that was my roof, is shattered by the
gale-5
Upon my undefended breast the showers of passion

hail.
No mendinfg now! The walls ‘decay; the house is-

toppling down.
