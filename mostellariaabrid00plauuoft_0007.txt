INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

The Flam—The Jlostellaria, written about two
hundred years before Christ, is one of the best plays
of Plautus, who took as his model a Greek comedy
named Phasma (The most), written probably by
Philemon, a celebrated poet of the New Comedy, who
Vflo-urished in the last decades of the fourth century B.C.
The name Mostellaria (A Tale of a Boyey) is derived
from one of the most effective scenes of the play.

The Flet—Theopropides, an Athenian merchant, is
abroad in Egypt. In his absence his son Philolaches,
abetted by a clever and knavish slave named Tranio,
has given himself up to wild living· His chief
escapade 13 10 buy a slave-girl, Philematium, with
whom he has fallen in love, and to give her her
freedom. For this purpose he has bon-owed money
from an usurer named Misargrvrides.

On the day on which the action opens Philolaches,
with Philematium and his friend Callidamates, is
sitting· at table when Tranio arrives from the
harbour to say that he has seen Theopropides coming
ashore. Philolaches is panio-stricken, but Tranio
undertakes to extricate him. The house is shut· up as
if deserted, and when Theopropides arrives Tranio
tells him that- it is haunted and induces him to run
away in terror.

Misarg'yrides enters to demand payment of his
interest, and at· the same moment Theopropides
returns. The slave persuades the old man to 361116
matters with the money-lender, and, when asked what
has been done with the loan, tells his master that
Philolaches has bought the house next door in place of
the “ haunted ’' one. Theopropides expresses a desire
to see over it and Tranio escapes detection by 16111119,-
