PREFACE..

THIS abridgement of the Mostellaria has been made with
a view to its performance by members of the Classical
Society of this University; it is published with a verse—
translation primarily for the use os their audience, and also
in the· hope that others may find it useful, whether for
acting or as an introduction to the writings of a highly-
talented and amusing dramatist.

The text is based on the Teubner edition of Goetz
and Schoell: much use has also been made of Prof.
Sonnenschein’s admirable edition. The abridgement
has been made by the omission, not (as a rule) of whole
sceneS‚* but of a large number of isolated lines or short
passages, many of them apparently valueless. This text,
therefore, presents the whole of the plot.

At several points where excisions have been made, and
where the text is faulty or incomplete, it has been
necessary to alter or supply the Latin. With one ex-
ception (see Prof. Conway's note on page 83 of the ⁴
text) these alterations do no violence to the meaning of
the passages in which they occur.

The translation has been written by the following
members of the Classical Society: Miss H. L. Chaffers,
Miss A. Greenhalgh‚ Miss S. E. Jackson, BA„ Miss J
Nicholson, Miss E. Watson, ΜΓ. W. T. Parker, my

*The only passages of interest or length which have been
omitted are (i.) the short scene—annising but hroarlly farcit-al
—between Delphiuni and Callidamatem (ii.) the soliloqny of
Simo, which explains the ill-hnmonron which Tranio so cleverly
tr22‹1es; (iii.) the soliloqny of Phanisvns and his conversation
with Pinacium. a passage whifeh is utterly nninteresting.
