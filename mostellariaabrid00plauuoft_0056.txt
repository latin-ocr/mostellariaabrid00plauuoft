SI. Why, what-'s he dreaming of? TR. I’ll tell you
true:
To mate his 8011 111 wedlook he's all haste,
And therefore would he build another bower.
Some master-builder's praised, he says, this house
For its design‚ as topping all perfection.
Hence would he seek a pat-tern, by your leave 3
And all the more he‘s bent on imitation,
Because in summer 'neath the cloudless ray
Here's 0001081 shade, he⁷s heard, 1110 livelong day.
SI. Nay, marry, wheresoever shade there be,
From morn 10 eve we've 81111 3 blazing sun
Stands ever 31 the door like ‹lebtor‘s dun.
No shade with us, save in 1110 well, p‘erchance.
TR. Yet he would view 11. SI. Let 111111, if he will.
If auf-*ht he finds 10 811111 him, he may build
After our pat‘sern. TR. Shall 1 0311 him? SI. Do.

These old men both I've saddlod with my tales.
A splendid 'trade' this is 11131 I've invented.
Your muleteer has mules 10 carry loads,
But I've {rot two-legged asses in my service.
They've got broad backs; no load 100 great for
them !
