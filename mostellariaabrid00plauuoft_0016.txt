[Emer Philolaches. Ile wallus moodz'ly about the
staye and adar-esses the audient-e]

I've pondered and pondered
And inwardly wondered‚
With longthy reflections I've puzzled my hrain—-
If with such Ι am gifted——
I'vo sem-ebed and I'vo sifted
The lna-tter all over and over again:
In what fashion a mortal ‘that's born on this earth
May bc fitly presented:
To what shall I liken a. man from his birth?
Now the p'attern I've found
(Ne'er a better invented)
’Tis a house that has newly been raised from the
ground.
Tho ploos of it—listen—I’ll shortly expound.
’Tis parents build the growing child ;
From basoment up ‘to topmost roof
They rear tho stmucture firmly piled,
And fain would make it weathor proof.
While in the builders’ hands I stayed,
A dutiful good child was 1;
But when my true bent Ι displayed,
Straightway I spoiled their industry.
Came sloth, a wast-ing storm that battered
My head with floods of rain and hail,
Dispelled all shame, all virtues soattered,
And left me roofless to the gale.
That breaeh to heal I took no care:
Noxt Love⁷s soft showers began fo pour
That trickled through my bosom bare
And drenohed my beart unto the core.
Now name· and fame, goods, virtue, honour, all
Are flod: behold a worthless wretch forlorn.
How should I mend this fenemont outworn?
My soaked bcams rot, and soon the- house must fall
