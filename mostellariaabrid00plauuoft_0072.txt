PH. Liberty's a eloak for your back; as for me,
If I do not serve and fear my master, covering none
have Ι.

S. E. J.

TH. By heavens, I am undone! What need of words?
I've seen not only Effirpt, it appears,
But. e'en to desert lands and shores remote
My voyage has reached; so little do I know
VVhere now I stray. Ah! now the t-ruth I’ll learn,

[Emeum PH. and Pl. - γ’ '

[Emer Simo. '

For here’s the man whose house my son has bought.
[To Simo] What do you?

SI. From the mart I'm going home.
TH. Aught, new from there?
SI. Aye, sir.
TH. Let’s hear it, pray.
SI. I’ve seen a funeral.
TH. Great news, i' saith!
SI. I say I’ve seen a funeral. They said,
He'd lately been alive.
TH. A truce to jests.
SI. Wherefore thus idly do you seek for news?

TH. Ι come from distant shores. Lend me your ear,
If nothing else your presence claims.
SI. Say on.
TH. Methinks you have received a hundred pounds
From my son's hand.
SI. Methinks not one poor cent.
TH. Well then, from Tranio.
SI. Still less from him!
TH. Not. as part payment of the sum?
SI. You dream.
TH. I dream? ’Tis you, who hope, by this pretence,

To cancel what, he paid.
SI. Why, what's all this?
