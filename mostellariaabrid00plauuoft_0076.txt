SI. They are at, your service.
TH. Meanwhile, I'll explain

The plot he's used to hoodwink me ‘to-day.

[Eoeeunt. A. G.
[Emer Tranio]
TR. He who shrinks in time of peril really isn't worth
a straw.

When ¹¹¹3* master first despatched me out of town ‘to

fetch his son,

Off I went along the alleg: to our garden on the slyr,

Then I opened wide the postern, opened wide the

garden-gate,

Out. of that Ι led my legion, all my man· and

woman-kind.
[Simo's door rattles.

What's the meaning of the rattling, close beside me,

all too close?

Yes, my niaster's there for cert-ain, I must sample his

remarks.

[Ile hides. Enim· from Simo's house Theopropides
(md two slaves, the latter with handcuffs and
wlzips. The slaves remam at the door, while Th.
comes forwawl]

ΤΗ. Stand you there within the doorway, so that,
when you hear my voice,
You may bustle out (lireotly, quiokly put the hand-
cuffs on.
Him, who made me look so foolish, I’ll await before
the house,
Him, whose hide will look most foolish‚ if I live
another day.
ΤΗ. [As-ide] Yes, it's clear enough; now, Tranio, you
must. settle what to do.
TH. Ι must do some skilful angling, when he comes
upon the ¹soene.

I'll pretend Ι know just nothing.
ΤΠ. [Aside] Oh! What deadly dodginess!
